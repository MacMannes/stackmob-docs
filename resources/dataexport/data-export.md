Export StackMob Data
=====================================

## Overview

StackMob enables you to
[export](https://dashboard.stackmob.com/data/export) the data from both your
development and production environments.

This includes:
* API data 
* Push tokens
* Facebook/Twitter credentials

Due to security concerns, user passwords and Facebook/Twitter tokens are
not exported.

## API Data Format

From the [data export page](https://dashboard.stackmob.com/data/export),
you can select between JSON or CSV formats.

Note that the id/primary key associated with each schema is annotated as "_id"
(rather than the custom primary key alias).
