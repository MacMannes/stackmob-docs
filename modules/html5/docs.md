StackMob HTML Hosting
=====================================

## Hosting your HTML5 App on StackMob

StackMob's HTML5 service and <a href="https://developer.stackmob.com/tutorials/js">Javascript SDK</a> (built upon <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>) lets you host your web app on StackMob while connecting to StackMob's API seamlessly through same-domain Javascript AJAX calls.

### Why an HTML5 Hosting Service on StackMob?

Because your web app is served directly from StackMob, this circumvents any potential cross-domain AJAX call restrictions.  No matter where your web app is run, you don't need to worry about whether a browser supports CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) headers nor about same domain origin policies.  After all, it **is** the same domain.  In doing so, we broaden your app support so that you can reach a wider audience.

## StackMob's integration with GitHub

Using GitHub to link your files to StackMob allows you to have fine-grained control over what exactly you're releasing, while giving you the flexibility to quickly and <a href="https://github.com/features/hosting" target="_blank">easily edit your code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/projects" target="_blank">collaborate with other developers</a>.


### What is GitHub?

GitHub's a version control service based on Git. It's easy to use and read to go for you immediately.  If you aren't already on GitHub, you can <a href="https://github.com/signup/free" target="_blank">sign up for a free GitHub account</a>.  You can always upgrade to a paid account later if you'd like to have some private projects.

It's great to save your code there and collaborate with team members and can greatly help.


### Video: GitHub and StackMob Integration Tour

Here's a short video showing how a user like you can link your GitHub account to StackMob, and how StackMob can start seamlessly serving your web app for you automatically:

Read on to see how you can link your StackMob app with GitHub and start serving your web app from StackMob.

## Setting up GitHub with StackMob

Let's link your existing GitHub repository with StackMob.  Visit your <a href="https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/html5/settings" target="_blank">HTML5 Hosting settings page</a>.

Click "Link StackMob with GitHub" and accept the authorization request.  You'll see a UI where you can choose your GitHub organization and Repository.

<p class="screenshot"><a href="https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/html5/settings" target="_blank"><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/static.stackmob.com/images/modules/html5/modules-html5-linked-account.png" alt=""/></a></p>

Choose your repository and StackMob will fetch your files and start serving them in your development environment for you immediately.  You can check its status:

<p class="screenshot"><a href="https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/html5/settings" target="_blank"><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/static.stackmob.com/images/modules/html5/modules-html5-status.png" /></a>
</p>

And you can also check your roll history:

<p class="screenshot"><a href="https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/html5/deployment_history" target="_blank"><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/static.stackmob.com/images/modules/html5/modules-html5-roll-history.png" /></a></p>

Below, presume that we have the file `index.html` in the root directory of our repo declaring `Hello World!`.

<p class="screenshot"><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/static.stackmob.com/images/screenshots/overview/StackMob_HTML_helloworld1.png" /></p>

If at any time you want to stop hosting files on StackMob, you can disable hosting by unchecking the "Enable HTML5 Serving".  The URL will then no longer be active.

## Enabling automatic deployment

StackMob can also automatically deploy your development environment whenever you commit to your GitHub repository.  Just enable that functionality below:

<div class="screenshot"><a href="https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/html5/settings" target="_blank"><img src="//s3.amazonaws.com/static.stackmob.com/images/modules/html5/modules-html5-service-hook.png" /></a>
</div>


## Deploying from development to production

Once you've completed developing your app, you'll want to deploy it to production.  For HTML5 Hosted apps, this involves deploying both your API and  HTML5 app.  Deploying to production allows you to continue working in develpment without affecting your users.

This video walks through the process of deploying to production.
