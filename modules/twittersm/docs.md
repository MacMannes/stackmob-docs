Twitter with StackMob
=====================================

## Overview

The StackMob Twitter module enables you to log in users into your StackMob application with Twitter.  It'll allow you to be able to create user objects from the Facebook access token you receive upon logging in.

With a user associated with a Twitter access token/login, you can now login a person with Twitter.

The StackMob Twitter module is installed and enabled by default
