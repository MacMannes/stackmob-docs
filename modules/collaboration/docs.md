StackMob Collaboration
=====================================

# Setup

[Go to the collaboration settings page here.](https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/collaboration/settings)

You can also get to this page in a few ways:

* On the [dashboard](https://dashboard.stackmob.com), you can click on your name / email an the top right of the page. Then choose `Organization` from the dropdown menu.
* On [dashboard](https://dashboard.stackmob.com), choose `Collaboration` in the left-hand menu.
* On [dashboard](https://dashboard.stackmob.com), choose `My Modules` in the left-hand menu. Then click on the `Collaboration` picture on the page or `Collaboration` text from the left side bar menu -> Click on `Settings` button 
* On `My Modules` page, find `Collaboration` picture and click on `Settings` right away (there are Info | Settings | Docs).

Once you're on that page (assuming you created the organization, hence you're the owner), you'll need to first create a team.  

**To create a team:**

1. Click the `+ Create New Team` button
2. Specify your team name
3. Add at least 1 member (email address) to your team (by default you can have a maximum of 3 team members).
4. Specify the permission (whether you want the team to be Admin, Engineer, or Marketing) 
5. Click on `Create Team` button

Now you can assign that team to different apps in your org by clicking on `Assign Team to an App` button. 
To add more team member, you just need to click on `+ Add New` on the bottom right table (Team Members table).


If you want to add members to your organization, you will need to add them into a team. 
If you are an org member but you do not belong to any team, you cannot do anything. You will need to be in a team, and this team needs to be assigned to an app in order for its team members to access that app. 
If you are an owner though, you do not need to be in a team. As an owner of an org, you can access all the apps and do "magical" things for that org.

Note: only owners of the organization can create or delete a new team, modify it, and assign it to an app. If you're not an owner, you will need to ask one of the owners to promote you to be one.

How to promote an org member to owner:   
1. An org owner needs to go to the Collaboration page and hover on one of the org member emails (Member table, top right).   
2. Click on the left arrow that shows up and that user will become an owner.  


# TroubleShooting:

If for some reason clicking on any button does not do anything, try refreshing the page or log out and log back in.
