<h2>Introduction to Apple Push Notifications</h2>

Before you start using push notifications on StackMob, you should familiarize yourself with the client-side aspects of Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) by reading the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH1-SW1">Local Notifications and Push Notification Programming Guide</a>. Don't worry about the server-side aspects of push - that's what we're here for.

<h2>Apple Push Notifications on StackMob</h2>

StackMob helps you with your Push Notification process by providing you the backend to send push messages. Follow these steps to get Push running for your mobile application.

1. Generate a .p12 Push Certificate for your app from Apple
2. Upload your Push Certificate to StackMob
3. Get a valid Device Token for your mobile device for testing
4. Send push notifications to your mobile device from StackMob's web console

<h2>Getting a Push Certificate</h2>

To use the push service you'll need to obtain push certificates from Apple and upload them to the StackMob server.

Follow the instructions in <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ProvisioningDevelopment/ProvisioningDevelopment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH104-SW1">Apple's Push Notification Programming Guide</a> to create a certificate file in .p12 format. Follow the instructions to step 3 of "Installing the SSL Certificate and Key on the Server." When you export the certificate and key, you will be prompted for an optional password. **DO** provide a password. We will not be able to use a certificate without a password. **Skip steps 4 and 5.** StackMob servers require a .p12 file, not a .pem file. A development certificate will be enough to get started.

StackMob has a development and production environment for you. When you're interacting with the development version of StackMob's API, development certificates will be used to send push notifications. **When you're ready to deploy your app, you'll need to get a production certificate by following the same instructions.**

<h2>Upload your Push Certificate to StackMob</h2>

Because StackMob will be handling your push services, you will need to <a href="https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/push/settings/android" target="_blank">upload your push certificates to StackMob</a>.

<a href="https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/push/settings/android" class="screenshot" target="_blank"><img src="https://dashboard.stackmob.com/images/tutorials/StackMob_Upload_Push_Certs.png"/></a>

Browse to your saved .p12 file, select the appropriate environment, enter the certificate password, and upload your certificates. If everything went fine, you'll see a page confirming that you have a Development certificate on file.

<h2>Using iOS Push SDK Version 1.0.1</h2>

With the release of the new iOS SDK, all push support has been moved into a seperate SDK.

For documentation and downloads, visit the [SMPushClient class reference](http://stackmob.github.com/stackmob-ios-push-sdk/Classes/SMPushClient.html)

**You do not need to read ahead unless you are using v0.5.x of the iOS SDK!**

<h2>Push support for iOS SDK Version 0.5.x</h2>

<h3>Getting a valid Device Token for your mobile device</h3>

Now that you have a certificate, we want to test sending/receiving push notifications. To do so, you'll need to get a valid device token from Apple. You can retrieve one through a local test iOS app.

Set up an iOS app to register for remote notifications by calling `registerForRemoteNotificationTypes` when your app launches. Implement the method `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` which will be called when your app successfully registers with APNS.

```objective-c
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: 
     (UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound)];
```

```objective-c
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)app didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken 
{
    NSString *token = [[deviceToken description] stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString:@"<>"]];
    token = [[token componentsSeparatedByString:@" "] componentsJoinedByString:@""];
    // Persist your user's accessToken here if you need
    [[StackMob stackmob] registerForPushWithUser:currentUser.userName token:token andCallback:^(BOOL success, id result){
        if(success){
            // token saved sucessfully for user
        }
        else{
            // Unable to register device for PUSH notifications 
            // Failed.  Alert your delgates
        }
    }];
}
```

<h3>Sending Push Messages</h3>

You can send push messages to any registered device token, or any user that has a device token associated with the account (using the `registerForPushWithUser:andToken:andCallback` method above). You can also broadcast a message to every registered device token.

To send a message to devices by token:

```objc
NSMutableDictionary *args = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithCapacity:3];
[args setValue:@"my push message" forKey:@"alert"];
[args setValue:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1] forKey:@"badge"];

NSArray *tokens = // create NSArray of tokens you want to send a notification to

[[StackMob stackob] sendPushToTokensWithArguments:args withTokens:tokens andCallback:^(BOOL success, id result) {
  // success will be true if the notification was successfully queued
}]
```

To send a message to users:

```objc
NSMutableDictionary *args = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithCapacity:3];
[args setValue:@"my push message" forKey:@"alert"];
[args setValue:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1] forKey:@"badge"];

NSArray *userIds = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"john", "mike", nil];

[[StackMob stackob] sendPushToUsersWithArguments:args withUserIds:userIds andCallback:^(BOOL success, id result) {
  // success will be true if the notification was successfully queued
}]
```

To send a broadcast to all registered devices: 

```objc
NSMutableDictionary *args = [NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithCapacity:3];
[args setValue:@"my push message" forKey:@"alert"];
[args setValue:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1] forKey:@"badge"];

[[Stackmob stackmob] sendPushBroadcastWithArguments:args andCallback:^(BOOL success, id result) {
  // success will be true if the notification was successfully queued
}]
```
